JEWELS (proof of concept)
=========================
I wanted to make my clone of this popular gem shifting game. I was disappointed in the way how, for example, android versions were so bad. Not very fluid interaction with game board. User should not be waiting while new gems are dropping to board.

So this is how it should be done. I knew it was easy to make it better than those furstrating crappy versions.

This is just prosessing sketch, so it was just PROOF OF CONCEPT. Maybe I add some features, like sound and real scoring. Maybe some day it will be converted for android phones'n'tablets.

Features:
- Move blocks also diagonally, could be easily disabled
- no "no moves" due low gem types (just 7 different), and due diagonal-move
